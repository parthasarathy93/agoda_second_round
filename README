=======================================AKKA_HTTP_SERVICE_API_FOR_HOTEL=======================================

We have api for creating users, retreiving all users, retrieving single user, deleting a user and creating apikey for the user , ratelimiting the apis 

All  the apikeys have 1 hour validity 


Ratelimiting can be changed via http.conf under the home folder , and the server has to be restarted for this to take effect. By default the global ratelimit is set as 10 seconds ie . one request per 10 seconds


All users and apikeys are inmemory storage, so we have to add users everytime we start the server


The server will be running in port 8080


How to run the server?

  Prerequisites:
      Make sure have java 8 and sbt installed in your machine

1. Under the home folder in command prompt/terminal , type sbt

2. You will see the sbt console up and running , it will be downloading all the dependent files which is configured in build.sbt file


3.then type "reStart" in sbt shell, you will be shown a prompt as the server is running in port 8080
